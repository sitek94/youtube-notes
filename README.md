# YouTube Notes

A Chrome Extension for taking quick notes while watching a Youtube video

## Why

I'm watching a YouTube video and I want to take some notes, but I don't want to open a Notes App, split screen, etc. 

I want to have a textarea field next to the YT video that I'm watching where I can enter my notes.

### v1 

* Notes should be persistent, initially `localStorage` should be enough.

### v2

* Save notes to Notion
